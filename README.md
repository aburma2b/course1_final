This repository holds the code for the final assignment for the Coursera course: Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments.

The base files were provided by the course and can be found at this repo: https://github.com/afosdick/ese-coursera-course1.git
Some of the functions were finished by me as per the course requirement.

The purpose of this assignment was to practice writing functions which did some memory manipulation, to practice using the build system and makefiles, and get more experience using git. 

All the functions in stats.c (except main) were written by me. Stats.h was also populated by me.
Memory.c, memory.h, data.c, and data.h were made from scratch by me to satisfy the assignment requirements.
